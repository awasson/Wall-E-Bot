# Wall-E-Bot
Repository for code, photos and build notes regarding an autonomic robot from a repurposed child's Wall-E robot toy. 

The robot uses an Arduino Nano (Every) with a servo shield and a 5 cell lithium ion pack for power. Full size continuous rotation servos provide locomotion and steering, mini servos manage the head horizontal movement and left/right arm movement. An ultrasonic ping sensor with transmitter and receiver mounts where the toy robot LED "eyes" were and rear mounted blue LED's provide perimeter lighting when the robot is active.
